# Introduction

As learned on previous courses, distributed systems present a lot of advantages over monolythic services. Such advantages come over with an increase of the system complexity, as the same is distributed between several nodes. Many algorithms exist to face these situations, but we consider there are not many practical examples of them.

Hence, looking forward to test some of these algorithms by our own, we proposed to develop a distributed platform for orchestrating applications via a computers cluster. This way, we had to deal with topics such as leader election, fault tolerance and state reconciliation. The following sections further explain how our cluster work, what problems we had to face and how we solved them.

# Architecture overview

# Launching a job

# Masters leader election

# Nodes state reconciliation

# Problems identified solved

# Conclusions

To sum up, we were able to successfully develop from scratch the proposed platform, facing and solving many problems inherent to distributed systems. The implemented cluster can launch jobs and reschedule them when a node fails, thus providing its main service as an orchestration platform. Although we know there are many things to improve, we consider the main goal for this project was achieved, since we have successfully discussed and implemented various relevant distributed algorithms.
